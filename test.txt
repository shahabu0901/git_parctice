(1) What is Java..
Ans:- Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and versatile
 programming language that was first developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation)
 in the mid-1990s. It was designed with the goal of being platform-independent,
 meaning that Java programs can run on various operating systems without modification. 
This portability is achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets and 
executes Java bytecode, allowing it to run on different platforms that have a compatible JVM.

Key characteristics and features of Java include:

Platform Independence: Java applications are compiled into bytecode,
 which can be executed on any system with a compatible JVM. This "write once,
 run anywhere" capability makes Java popular for cross-platform development.

Object-Oriented: Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language,
 which means it encourages the use of objects, classes, and inheritance in software design.

Robust: Java has built-in features for error handling and memory management, 
helping to create reliable and stable applications.

Secure: Java includes various security features, such as a security manager,
 which can control the access to system resources, and a strong emphasis on
 preventing common programming errors that can lead to security vulnerabilities.

Multi-threading: Java has built-in support for multithreading, allowing developers to create
 applications that can execute multiple tasks concurrently, making it suitable for
 building scalable and responsive applications.

Rich Standard Library: Java comes with a vast standard library (Java API)
 that provides pre-built classes and methods for common programming tasks,
 making development faster and more efficient.

Community and Ecosystem: Java has a large and active developer community,
 which has led to the creation of many open-source libraries and frameworks,
 making it versatile for various application domains.

Popular in Various Domains: Java is widely used in various domains,
including web development (Java EE),
mobile app development (Android), enterprise software,
scientific computing, and more.

Versions: Java has gone through several versions and updates over the years.
The most recent long-term support (LTS) version as of my
last knowledge update in September 2021 was Java 17. However,
there may have been newer versions released since then.

Java's versatility, performance, 
and strong ecosystem have made it a popular choice for a wide range of
applications and industries. Its ability to run on different platforms and its
focus on security make it particularly suitable for mission-critical
and enterprise-level software development.
